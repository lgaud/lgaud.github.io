### Make transfering from the train less of a pain!

Do you have several different routes you can take at Tunney's Pasture? 
Open up OC Trainsfer just before arriving at the station, and it will
call the OC Transpo GPS feed to get the next few trips for the routes 
you've chosen to watch.

The first release is specific to Tunney's Pasture, but Hurdman and Blair are coming soon!
