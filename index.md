## *Indie Founder and Software Developer*
Hi, I'm Lisa. I've been in software and data science for over a decade.

I've been exploring my entrepreneurial side lately, but I'd love to help you put the pieces together on a freelance, contract, or part time basis. I can help you leverage Azure Cognitive Services and Search and integrate these tools with your applications and other APIs.

You can find me on Twitter at [@lisa_gaud](https://twitter.com/lisa_gaud) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisagaud/).

## Current Projects: 
### [PyNotion.com](https://www.pynotion.com/)
I've been diving into the Notion API and writing tutorials using the API with Python.

### [Plankido.com](https://www.plankido.com)
I am currently working on building [Plankido.com](https://www.plankido.com) to serve online fitness creators selling workout programs. 
As part of that I've built [Workout Loop](https://www.plankido.com/loop) which lets people easily create and share fitness programs made using YouTube videos. 
Here's an example of [Short Workouts to build and maintain a habit](https://www.plankido.com/posts/short_workouts_to_build_habit/).
I have launched [Plankido Video Scheduler](https://www.wix.com/app-market/plankido-video-scheduler) on the Wix App Market to give YouTube creators with Wix websites another window into their YouTube channel, for content that isnâ€™t meant to be binged, like follow along fitness and meditation videos.

## Side Projects
I have a variety of small side projects in the [Side Projects](Projects/index.html) section. This includes several data analysis and visualization projects, 
as well as the [Color Contrast Matrix](Projects/Colours/contrast_matrix.html) tool to generate a colour contrast matrix for an entire colour palette, ideal for checking categorical colour palettes for more accessible visualization.

## Past Projects 
### OC Trainsfer App (Archived)
When our new Light Rail system was launched, I wanted to be able to check which bus stop to go to to get me home fastest. So I made a React Native app called [OC Trainsfer](OCTrainsfer)!
However, the API information was not very useful when the buses were at their first stop, and combined with me not taking transit due to now working from home
I discontinued this app.
