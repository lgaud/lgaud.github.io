# Lisa Gaudette - Indie Founder and Software Developer
Hi, I'm Lisa. I've been in software and data science for over a decade, and now I'm branching out on my own. You can find me on Twitter at [@lisa_gaud](https://twitter.com/lisa_gaud) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisagaud/) 

## Current Project
I am currently working on building [Plankido.com](https://www.plankido.com) to serve online fitness creators selling fitness programs. 
As part of that I've built [Workout Loop](https://www.plankido.com/loop) which lets people easily create and share fitness programs made using YouTube videos. 
Here's an example of [Short Workouts to build and maintain a habit](https://www.plankido.com/posts/short_workouts_to_build_habit/).

## Side Projects
I have a variety of small side projects in the [Side Projects](Projects/index.html) section. This includes several data analysis and visualization projects, 
as well as the [Color Contrast Matrix](Projects/Colours/contrast_matrix.html) tool to generate a colour contrast matrix for an entire colour palette, ideal for checking categorical colour palettes for more accessible visualization.

## Past Projects 
### OC Trainsfer App (Archived)
When our new Light Rail system was launched, I wanted to be able to check which bus stop to go to to get me home fastest. So I made a React Native app!
However, the API information was not very useful when the buses were at their first stop, and combined with me not taking transit due to now working from home
I discontinued this app.
