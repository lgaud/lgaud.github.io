## *Indie Founder and Software Developer*
Hi, I'm Lisa. I've been in software and data science for over a decade, and now I'm branching out on my own as a solopreneur. You can find me on Twitter at [@lisa_gaud](https://twitter.com/lisa_gaud) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisagaud/).

## Current Project: [Plankido.com](https://www.plankido.com)
I am currently working on building [Plankido.com](https://www.plankido.com) to serve online fitness creators selling workout programs. 
As part of that I've built [Workout Loop](https://www.plankido.com/loop) which lets people easily create and share fitness programs made using YouTube videos. 
Here's an example of [Short Workouts to build and maintain a habit](https://www.plankido.com/posts/short_workouts_to_build_habit/).

## Side Projects
I have a variety of small side projects in the [Side Projects](Projects/index.html) section. This includes several data analysis and visualization projects, 
as well as the [Color Contrast Matrix](Projects/Colours/contrast_matrix.html) tool to generate a colour contrast matrix for an entire colour palette, ideal for checking categorical colour palettes for more accessible visualization.

## Past Projects 
### OC Trainsfer App (Archived)
When our new Light Rail system was launched, I wanted to be able to check which bus stop to go to to get me home fastest. So I made a React Native app called [OC Trainsfer](OCTrainsfer)!
However, the API information was not very useful when the buses were at their first stop, and combined with me not taking transit due to now working from home
I discontinued this app.
